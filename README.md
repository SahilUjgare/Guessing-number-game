## ðŸ“œ How to Play

1. When the game starts, you set:
   - Lower bound of the number range
   - Upper bound of the number range
   - Number of attempts

2. The computer will think of a random number in your chosen range.

3. You try to guess the number within the given attempts:
   - If your guess is **too high** or **too low**, you get a hint.
   - If you are **very close** (within 5 numbers), youâ€™ll get a "ðŸ”¥ Very close!" hint.
   - If you wish to play again you can type 'yes' or 'no'.

4. At the end of the game:
   - If you guess correctly â†’ ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!
   - If you fail â†’ ðŸ˜¢ Game over (the correct number will be revealed).
